    <h1> Contrast for inclusive design
    </h1>
  </header>


    <p><br><i>
    Contrast in design is one of the main elements that we need to consider when thinking about inclusive design.</i> </p><br>
    
    <p>Contrast helps making the content assessable for the reader, its aids text and elements on your site to stand out from each other and show clearly their relationship with one another. The WCAG 2 sets out the legal requirements for services to provide in regards to the accessibility to their services. This guide is a useful tool to make sure that the product being designed is following inclusive design principles. Making sure that all types of users are able to navigate, use and understand the product. </p><br>
    <p>The WCAG 2 uses a system to measure the contrast ratio of colours brightness side by side. This could be a card on a background, a call to action button on a card and all text on site that needs to be legible.
    This is shown in a ratio in the format of 1:1. White on white than being 1:1 while for example black on white being 1:21 contrast ratio. <br>
    To make sure that the website is assessable to all the contrast minimum of brightness must be at least 4.5:1 unless;
    Large text that can be 3:1 and logotypes or text that is for decorative purposes needs not to follow contrast rules.<br>
    It is good to keep in mind that this is only the minimum requirements and does therefor not mean that it is always very legible.<br>
    In the WCAG 2 criteria all colours adjacent with each other must meet the 4.5:1 contrast. This is called a AA criteria to achieve a AAA criteria the contrast requirements must be 7:1 for normal text and 4,5: for large text.</p><br>
    
    <p>Contrast helps the user understand the relationship between elements, the lack of contrast can show that the elements have a similar role, for example a dark blue background and a lighter blue background of a card. They both serve the purpose of background for the text or buttons. <br>
    However having more contrast colour can indicate the importance of a ruling elements in the design, such as a call to action button. <br>
    The colour red for example is often used as a warning colour or for the purpose of deleting information. It is important to contrast that with another colour otherwise the purpose is lost. A red delete button on a red page would not be visible and therefor not send out a warning signal.</p><br>
    
    <p>The topic of inclusive design is a large one and will not be studied in a day, understanding all of our users needs, ranging from browser support to actual physical assistance, will not be learned in a day and perhaps never fully. Therefor it is important to use user research from people that actually need to use tools to support them navigate products. Someone that uses a screen saver is much more capable of telling you how the site works for them, as they are familiar with the tool. You as a designer testing for a week does not give you the same result. <br>
    There are many programs that help with aspects of inclusive design, such as Figma, sketch and adobe experience. There are also websites where you can test how assessable your site is. Down-below is a link tree for some interesting resources. </p><br>
    
    <p>We should all strive to make our products and design work for all of our users and start with designing our product straight away for everyone, instead of fixing it later.<br>
    Inclusive design benefits everyone, having a product that is simple, easily navigated and visually and textually clear, makes the experience enjoyable for all. </p><br><br>
